ðŸ“Œ Algorithm for Traveling Half-Square Pulse Simulation

Initialize environment

Clear workspace, close figures, reset command window.

Define parameters

Amplitude of pulse a

Rope length L_rope

Pulse width L_pulse

Number of harmonics N (controls sharpness of square pulse approximation)

Wave speed velocity

Generate spatial and temporal grids

x: equally spaced points along the rope

t: discrete time steps for animation

Define initial half-square pulse

Use an anonymous function f0(x) that is nonzero only in the middle segment of the rope.

Compute Fourier sine coefficients

For each harmonic n = 1â€¦N, integrate the product of f0(x) and sin(nÏ€x/L_rope) over the rope length.

Precompute spatial sine terms

Store all sine functions for efficiency.

Initialize plot

Create figure with proper labels, title, and y-axis limits.

Animation loop

For each time step t(k):

Compute angular frequencies Ï‰n

Multiply Fourier coefficients with cos(Ï‰n t) (time evolution of standing waves)

Reconstruct displacement y_total(x,t) as sum of all harmonics

Update plot in real time.

End simulation

Result is a smooth traveling half-square pulse animation.
